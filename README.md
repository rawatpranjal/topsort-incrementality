# topsort-incrementality

This repo adopts a self-contained analysis structure under `exploration/`. Each numbered subfolder holds its own code, artifacts, and summary.

Structure
- `exploration/` â€” root for analyses
  - `01_eda_auctions/`
  - `02_eda_impressions/`
  - `03_eda_clicks/`
  - `04_eda_purchases/`
  - `05_build_master_funnel/`

Conventions
- Snowflake + Python.
- Analyses are reproducible and documented locally in each folder.
- Add plots/exports into the same subfolder.

See `exploration/README.md` for table of contents and instructions.
